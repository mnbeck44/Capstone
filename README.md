For my Capstone Project I developed a time series model to predict Amazon Wireless Services (AWS) Spot prices.  

AWS provides a cloud computing service and to leverage the capacity not being utilized by their subscribers they auction it off at a 50-90% discount for an indeterminate and unstable time. These auctioned instances are termed Spot Instances and their prices vary based on operating system, type (computing power), and zone they are located.  

 After overcoming obstacles of inconsistent and missing data; I transformed, fit and trained the data on an Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model that was eventually tested on a hold out set.

Next steps would be to explore and model using prices of other instance types as the time series independent variables, under the assumption that close substitutes are strong determinant factors in predicting prices.
